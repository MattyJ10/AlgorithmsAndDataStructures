String Problems:
	- See if sorting would help
	- See if iterating from the back of the array would help
	- Be careful about shifting arrays, ensure you don't overwrite things, often better to loop from back when shifting. 
	- Count characters with a hashtable (or map, set)
	- Ask about case sensitivity and Ascii values
	
LinkedList Problems:
	- See if you can implement multiple runners
	- Don't overthink the problem, if you're using a lot of pointers there's usually a simpler implementation
	- Ensure you don't access a null element
	- Make use of the "toolkit" (addToHead, addToTail, etc.)
