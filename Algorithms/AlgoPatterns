String Problems:
	- See if sorting would help
	- See if iterating from the back of the array would help
	- Be careful about shifting arrays, ensure you don't overwrite things, often better to loop from back when shifting. 
	- Count characters with a hashtable (or map, set)
	- Ask about case sensitivity and Ascii values
	
LinkedList Problems:
	- See if you can implement multiple runners
	- Don't overthink the problem, if you're using a lot of pointers there's usually a simpler implementation
	- Ensure you don't access a null element
	- Make use of the "toolkit" (addToHead, addToTail, etc.)
	
Graph Problems:
	- DFS is not meant to have a return value, checking for a path with it would require DFSing from the start node and marking all the nodes you visit,
		if the target is marked then there is a path. You'll need to adapt a function to call DFS and then return if the desired node marked or not. 
	- You can have a return type in BFS or you can have it be void like DFS and just mark all the values.
